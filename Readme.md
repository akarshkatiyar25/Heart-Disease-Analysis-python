## Overview
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide.  
This project explores a structured dataset of patient health records to uncover patterns and risk indicators of heart disease.  
Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning, the notebook demonstrates how data can support early detection and healthcare decision-making.

## Problem Statement
Healthcare professionals need better tools to identify patients at high risk of heart disease.  
This project aims to:  
- Explore relationships between clinical attributes and heart disease  
- Build predictive models to classify patients with/without heart disease  
- Provide insights that can guide preventive healthcare strategies  

---

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following attributes:  

- Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type  
- Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol  
- Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting ECG  
- Maximum Heart Rate, Exercise-Induced Angina  
- ST Depression, Slope, Number of Major Vessels, Thalassemia  

**Target variable:**  
- `target` → 1 (Heart disease present), 0 (No heart disease)

## Tools and Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)  
- Scikit-learn (machine learning)  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Methods
1. Data Preprocessing – handling missing values, encoding categorical variables  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis – visualizations to identify trends and relationships  
3. Correlation Analysis – heatmaps and feature importance checks  
4. Predictive Modeling – training classifiers to detect heart disease

## Key Insights
- Age, chest pain type, cholesterol, and maximum heart rate strongly influence heart disease presence  
- Patients with exercise-induced angina and abnormal ECG results show higher risk  
- Correlation analysis highlights which features are most predictive  

---

## Results and Conclusion
- The models successfully classified patients with/without heart disease  
- Visualizations provided a clear understanding of health indicators linked to risk  
- The project demonstrates how machine learning can support **preventive healthcare**

🔍 Overview

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. This project explores a structured dataset of patient health records to uncover patterns and risk indicators of heart disease. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and machine learning, the notebook demonstrates how data can support early detection and healthcare decision-making.

❓ Problem Statement

Healthcare professionals need better tools to identify patients at high risk of heart disease. This project aims to:

Explore relationships between clinical attributes and heart disease.

Provide insights that can guide preventive healthcare strategies.

📂 Dataset

The dataset includes the following attributes:

Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type

Resting Blood Pressure, Cholesterol

Fasting Blood Sugar, Resting ECG

Maximum Heart Rate, Exercise-Induced Angina

ST Depression, Slope, Number of Major Vessels, Thalassemia

Target variable:

target → 1 (Heart disease present), 0 (No heart disease)

🛠 Tools and Technologies

Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning and model building

Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

📊 Methods

Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis – Visualizations to identify trends and relationships.

Correlation Analysis – Heatmaps and feature importance checks.

🔑 Key Insights

Age, chest pain type, cholesterol, and maximum heart rate strongly influence heart disease presence.

Patients with exercise-induced angina and abnormal ECG results show higher risk.

Correlation analysis highlights which features are most predictive.

▶️ How to Run this Project

Clone or download the repository.

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter


Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook Heart_Disease_Analysis.ipynb


Run the cells step by step to reproduce the analysis.

📈 Results and Conclusion

The models successfully classified patients with/without heart disease.

Visualizations provided a clear understanding of health indicators linked to risk.
